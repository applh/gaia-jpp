# PHP vs Node Fastify

## SQLITE

* SQLite DB has a table with about 60.000 rows

### Setup 

4 differents setups on the same SQLite DB

* Node Fastify with fastify-sqlite, 
  * http://fastify-localhost:3000

* PHP with PDO
  * http://php-localhost:3666
  * with PHP built-in server 

* Node Fastify with fastify-sqlite, 
  * http://fastify.test:8666
  * inside Docker containers
  * with Nginx and Reverse Proxy 

* PHP with PDO
  * http://app2:test:8666
  * inside Docker containers
  * with Nginx and PHP-FPM 


### Commands


* localhost PHP
* https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php

```
php -S php-localhost.test:3666 -t public/

```
* Apache Bench

```
ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://php-localhost.test:3666/

### Performances 

About 10-15 ms per query to read 1000 rows
* with ORDER BY id DESC
* table about 60.000 rows

## Docker x Php Conflict

* if there's a Php loop and inside there's an include to a file which is mounted, then the execution time is very slow ðŸ˜±
* Hack: copy the file to include in the container local filesystem
  * the Php function tmpnam() can be used to create a temporary file
  * https://www.php.net/manual/fr/function.tempnam.php
  * ðŸ”¥ Only Php can move code dynamically so easily ðŸ˜Ž
  * Performances are then acceptable, but still slow ðŸ˜…
  * So best workaround is to avoid to include files in a loop ?! ðŸ˜…
